# PlatformForSimulationTrainingEvaluation
A platform which can be used to simulate OETPN, train the model and evaluate the performances.


The main class is OETPN, which models an OETPN. 

So far, only FuzzyTokens can be used (ActiveToken is not implemented). Please check the examples and see how you can specify an OETPN and especially the transitions (as they are a bit more tricky).

You can run the examples individually.
